Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. 

I'm working part-time on open-source on [Gladys Assistant](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys), a +40k downloads privacy-first home assistant. It runs on a Raspberry Pi, a Synology NAS, or any machine running Docker.

On my other part-time, I'm working for tech companies on the following technologies:

- Node.js: +7 years of XP, started playing with it in the early days aka Node 0.6!
- PostgreSQL: My go-to database for large server applications. Spent lots of time reading about PostgreSQL performance & tuning.
- Docker: Worked with Docker in production for years. 
- Redis, RabbitMQ.

I'm mainly working on the backend/infrastructure side, but I have strong skills in React as well.
