Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. 

Part-time, I work on [Gladys Assistant](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys), an open-source smart home software used by many users worldwide.

In the rest of my time, I work for tech companies, focusing on the following technologies:

- Node.js: Over 10 years of experience, started using it in the early days with Node 0.6!
- PostgreSQL: My go-to database for large server applications. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time studying PostgreSQL performance and tuning.
- Docker: Have worked with Docker in production for years.
- Redis, RabbitMQ.

I mainly work on the backend and infrastructure side, but I also have strong skills in React.
